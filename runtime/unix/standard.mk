# Purpose: Defines `shell`, `build`, `test` and `quickbuild` some of which are common
# targets in many Makefiles. If you have an existing Makefile, you rarely want to include this
# Makefile. Instead include the `base.mk`.
#
# Requires:
# - DKML_DIR (Makefile variable)
# - DKML_PLATFORMS (Makefile variable)
#
# Optional:
# - DKML_BUILDTYPES (Makefile variable). Must be a subset of: Debug Release ReleaseCompatPerf ReleaseCompatFuzz
