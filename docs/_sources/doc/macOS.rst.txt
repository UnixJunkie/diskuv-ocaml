Install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ if you haven't done so already.
Open `Terminal` and then run:

.. code-block:: zsh

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

have Git. Otherwise run the following in `Terminal`:

.. code-block:: zsh

    brew install git

Install Visual Studio Code if you haven't done so already.
Go to `Visual Studio Code Download <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download>`_
