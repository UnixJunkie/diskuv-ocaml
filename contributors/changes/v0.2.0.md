## 0.2.0 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

Backwards incompatible changes requiring the equivalent of a major version bump
(using semver minor bump since version is still less than 1.0.0):

* Renamed `make.cmd` to `makeit.cmd` so no PATH collision with Make

New features:

* Introduce `makeit` for Unix systems so that the same `./makeit` command can be
  communicated for both Windows and Unix users.
* Remove restriction on spaces in directory names.
