## 0.2.0 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

Backwards incompatible changes requiring the equivalent of a major version bump
(using semver minor bump since version is still less than 1.0.0):

* [windows only] Renamed `make.cmd` to `makeit.cmd` so no PATH collision with Make
* [windows only] Changed OPAMROOT from `$env:USERPROFILE/.opam` to `$env:LOCALAPPDATA/.opam`.
  New and upgraded local projects will automatically use the new OPAMROOT after you have
  run `./makeit init-dev` (or `./makeit prepare-dev` or `./makeit build-dev`). Save space by
  deleting `$env:USERPROFILE/.opam` when your local projects have been upgraded.

New features:

* Introduce `makeit` for Unix systems so that the same `./makeit` command can be
  communicated for both Windows and Unix users.
* Remove restriction on spaces in directory names.
* Speed up creating switches by not auto-installing pinned packages simply because
  they have Diskuv OCaml patches

New patches:

* `mirage-crypto.0.10.4-windowssupport` which is a few commits past `mirage-crypto.0.10.3`
  with a patch to make it work with the Microsoft compiler toolchain
* `ocamlbuild.0.14.0` has fdopen@'s patches for MinGW, plus a new patch to let `ocamlbuild -where`
  pass through Windows backslashed paths from `ocamlc -config` without interpreting the backslashes
  as OCaml escape sequences
* `core_kernel.v0.14.2` is not new, but now it is pinned so that the MSYS2 compatible version is
  used consistently
* `feather.0.3.0` patched to work with native Windows

New packages (so that opam depext functionality does not need to install anything):

* Native Windows `libffi` lets OCaml packages like `conf-libffi` and `ctypes` use a standardized, cross-platform
  foreign function interface
