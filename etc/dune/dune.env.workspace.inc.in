; WARNING: DO NOT EDIT BY HAND! This file is autogenerated from the Makefile.
;
; Purpose: This file sets compiler flags for the entire Dune workspace.
;
; The different target platforms and build types are defined canonically
; in TOPDIR/Makefile as PLATFORMS and BUILDTYPES.
;
; See doc/BUILDING.md for a more detailed description of how this works.
;
; Regeneration is done automatically by `make init-dev` so that any dev platform
; build (ie. done by a human developer) will update the file (if needed) and check it into source
; control.
;
; To force a regeneration of this file use the following (but you should never need to):
;    rm -f buildconfig/dune/dune.env.workspace.inc
;    make buildconfig/dune/dune.env.workspace.inc
; to regenerate this file.
;
; And you can change the header by editing buildconfig/dune/dune.env.workspace.inc.in.
;
; Flags doc at https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts.html#ocaml-flags. Some of the important s-expressions are:
; > (flags <flags>) to specify flags passed to both ocamlc and ocamlopt
; > (ocamlc_flags <flags>) to specify flags passed to ocamlc only
; > (ocamlopt_flags <flags>) to specify flags passed to ocamlopt only
