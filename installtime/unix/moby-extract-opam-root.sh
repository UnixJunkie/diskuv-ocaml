# Extract the tarballs
# Note: Excluding is less troublesome than including. If we used 'tar xf $t some/directory some/other/directory' and those directories
#       did not exist in the tar, the tar command would fail. Excluding never has that problem.
#       The only things we want are
#         a) the Opam root at `/opam/.opam`
#         b) the `ocaml-env*` executables at `/cygwin64/bin/ocaml-env*.exe` (they have no Cygwin library dependencies)
#         c) the Opam mingw repository at `/cygwin64/home/opam/opam-repository`
#         d) the etcetera files from `cygwin64/etc/` and related files in `cygwin64/usr/share/` so that when ocaml-opam's opam.exe spawns curl.exe in the PATH to download packages
#            and correctly finds build/_tools/common/cygwin/bin/curl.exe, and when the interprocess shared cygwin1.dll dependency
#            gives curl.exe the spawning Cygwin root (ocaml-opam/, not cygwin/) as the location of its etcetera files ... that curl.exe
#            can still read valid SSL certificate authority files. Ditto for any other opam.exe spawned process.
# Note 2: We have to check whether the tar files are actually JSON error files. We do that by checking if the first characters are '{"errors":'
